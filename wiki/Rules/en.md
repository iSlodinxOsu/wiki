# Rules

Welcome to Titanic, before you get started please read through these rules for a more safe and pleasent experience.

# Community Rules

1. **Each user may only have *ONE* account EVER!** The only exception to this rule is making bot accounts or other projects, but you must first let staff know so we can approve it. If you cannot access your email or you have forgot your password please open a support ticket in the [Titanic Discord](https://discord.gg/qryYG2C5nc) server.
2. **Play fair.** Using any third party tools that gives you an unfair advantage over people will result in a restriction. This includes programs like macros, cheat engine, aim-assist programs, timewarp, and so on. If you see some suspicious activity from a user, please open up a ticket in the [Titanic Discord](https://discord.gg/qryYG2C5nc) server.
3. **Be kind to people.** Any harrassment, racism, or antagonism has no place here in Titanic! This is just a server about clicking circles, catching fruit, bashing drums, and breaking keyboards whilst pretending to be cookiezi and playing old maps, not to be assholes to each other.
4. **No NSFW/18+ content.** Content that contains drug use or topics of a sexual nature are not welcome here.
